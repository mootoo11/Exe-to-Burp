# Exe to Burp

**Intercept traffic from ANY executable (.exe) using Burp Suite.**
This tool allows you to easily route traffic from Windows executables through a proxy (like Burp Suite), automatically bypassing SSL Pinning in Python and Node.js environments.

## 1. Requirements & Setup

Before running the tool, you need to set up the environment and certificates.

### Prerequisites
*   **Python 3.x**: Make sure it is installed and added to PATH.
*   **Burp Suite**: Or any other proxy tool (Fiddler, Charles).

### Installation
1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Generate Certificates (First Time Only)**:
    You need to generate a custom Root CA that your executables will trust.
    ```powershell
    python gen_cert_v2.py
    python make_p12.py
    ```
    *   This will create `server.crt` (Restricted CA) and `burp_custom_ca.p12`.

3.  **Import Certificate into Burp Suite**:
    *   Open **Burp Suite**.
    *   Go to **Proxy/Settings** -> **Proxy Listeners** -> **Import/export CA certificate**.
    *   Choose **Import** -> **Certificate and private key from PKCS#12 keystore**.
    *   Select the file: **`burp_custom_ca.p12`**.
    *   Enter Password: **`password`**.

## 2. Usage

You can launch any `.exe` file and force it to go through your proxy.

### Basic Command
```powershell
python burp_launcher.py -t <path_to_exe>
```

### Examples
**Run a target program:**
```powershell
python burp_launcher.py -t "C:\Path\To\program.exe"
```

**Run with a custom Proxy (not Burp):**
```powershell
python burp_launcher.py -t game.exe -p http://127.0.0.1:8888
```

**View Help:**
```powershell
python burp_launcher.py -h
```

## 3. Troubleshooting

### "SSL Certificate Verify Failed"
*   **Cause**: The application does not trust the certificate.
*   **Fix**: Ensure you have run `gen_cert_v2.py` and imported the resulting `.p12` file into Burp Suite correctly. The standard Burp certificate (`cacert.der`) often fails with modern Python, so you **must** use our custom generated one.

### "Target file not found"
*   **Cause**: You provided an incorrect path to the `.exe`.
*   **Fix**: Use quotes around the path if it has spaces, e.g., `"C:\My Files\app.exe"`.

### Traffic not showing in Burp
*   **Cause**: The application might disregard system proxy settings (rare).
*   **Fix**: This tool sets `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables. If the app ignores these, this tool cannot intercept it without further reverse engineering (e.g., proxifier).

## 4. How it Works

1.  **Environment Injection**: The script sets `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables for the target process, telling standard networking libraries to use your proxy.
2.  **SSL Trust**: It points `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` to our custom `server.crt`.
3.  **Strict CA**: The certificate generated by this tool (`gen_cert_v2.py`) includes specific fields (Key Usage, Subject Key Identifier) that simpler certificates lack, allowing it to bypass stricter SSL checks found in modern libraries like `urllib3` v2.0+ and Node.js.
